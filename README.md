# Python Repository 

Welcome to my Python practice repository!

# About

This repository is a collection of my Python practice code and assignments as I learn the language. I'm currently a beginner, and I'm using this space to:

- Practice Python syntax and concepts
- Solve beginner-level problems
- Complete small assignments
- Track my learning progress

If you're also learning Python, feel free to browse through the code. Maybe you'll find something helpful—or even share some tips!

# Repository Structure

The repo may include:

- `basics/` – basic Python programs (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- `assignments/` – solutions to practice assignments and small projects
- `exercises/` – mini coding exercises and problem-solving attempts
- `notes/` – (optional) my personal learning notes or comments

As I continue learning, I will keep updating this repository with new files and folders.

# Getting Started

To run any of the Python files:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3).
2. Clone the repo or download the files.
3. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder.
